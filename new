## Building and Hosting Your Full-Stack Portfolio Website on Free Hosting Providers

You want to build and host a **full-stack portfolio website** using free hosting providers — covering frontend (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap), backend (PHP + MySQL), APIs, and GitHub for version control.

---

### 1. Choose a Free Hosting Provider with PHP + MySQL Support

Popular free hosting options include:

* **InfinityFree** — PHP + MySQL, no forced ads, good for PHP backend
* **000webhost** — PHP + MySQL, easy setup
* **AwardSpace** — PHP + MySQL, limited storage but decent
* **Freehostia** — PHP + MySQL support
* **GitHub Pages** — For static sites only (HTML/CSS/JS), no PHP/MySQL

---

### 2. Structure Your Full-Stack Portfolio Website

**Frontend:**

* Responsive HTML + CSS + Bootstrap
* JavaScript for interactivity and API calls

**Backend:**

* PHP scripts to handle:

  * Contact form submissions
  * Dynamic content rendering (optional)
* MySQL database to store:

  * Contact messages
  * Project info, blog posts (optional)

**APIs:**

* Use public APIs (e.g., GitHub API for repos, weather APIs)
* Optionally create your own API endpoints with PHP for custom data

---

### 3. Development Workflow

* Develop locally using tools like XAMPP or LocalWP for PHP + MySQL testing
* Use **Git + GitHub** for version control
* Push updates regularly to GitHub
* Deploy your PHP + MySQL backend on your free hosting provider (e.g., InfinityFree)
* Use GitHub Pages for frontend-only or static demos

---

### 4. Deployment Tips on Free Hosts

* Upload your files via FTP or host’s file manager
* Set up your MySQL database in the hosting control panel
* Update your PHP connection credentials accordingly
* Test all forms and API interactions live on the host

---

### 5. Example Full-Stack Features for Your Portfolio

* **Homepage:** Personal intro + dynamic project list (from DB or GitHub API)
* **Projects Page:** Display projects fetched dynamically
* **Contact Page:** Form submits data to PHP script, saved in MySQL, with confirmation
* **Blog (Optional):** Manage and display posts stored in DB

---

### 6. Keep in Mind

* Free hosts often have limitations (storage, bandwidth, SSL availability)
* Sanitize all PHP inputs to prevent SQL injection and other security issues
* Regularly back up your database
* Use GitHub to showcase your code even if the live site is hosted elsewhere

---

To run locally:

1. Clone the repository:
