Here are some suggestions to make your index.html more friendly and personalized:

1. Correct the title typo:
   - Change `<title>Protfolio-website</title>` to `<title>Portfolio Website</title>`

2. Personalize the content:
   - Change the hero section to reflect your actual name and details, e.g., 
     - `<h1>Hi, I'm <span class="highlight">Satyam Thakur</span></h1>`
     - Update the subtitle and description to match your expertise.
   - In the About section, update the professional background and stats to your real experience.
   - Update the footer with your actual name and a correct email link (e.g., `mailto:satyamthakur@gmail.com`).

3. Accessibility improvements:
   - Add meaningful alt attributes to images, e.g., `<img src="..." alt="Satyam Thakur headshot">`
   - Ensure all icons and social links have descriptive `aria-label`s.

4. Navigation and contact:
   - Make sure all navigation and social links point to your actual profiles (GitHub, LinkedIn, Twitter, etc.).
   - In the footer, update all links and contact info to be accurate.

5. General friendliness:
   - Add a friendly introduction in the About section, such as: “Welcome to my portfolio! I’m excited to share my work with you.”
   - Consider adding a “scroll to top” button for easier navigation.
